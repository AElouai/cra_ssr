# cra_ssr Create React App with Server Side Rendering
create-react-app with server side rendering without ejecting  `npm run eject`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of create-react-app  guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) where you can find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

## Routing
we will be using [React Router V4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) .

## Store 
we will be using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for managing Store , if you want to use [Mobx]() you will have to update the config a little bit

you need to check [SSR in Redux](https://redux.js.org/recipes/server-rendering) if you plan tu use api call in tour app

it's recommended to install [Redux Devtools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) for debugging. 

## Test
we will be using [Jest]()
